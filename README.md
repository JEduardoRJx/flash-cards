## Introduction
Flash Cards is the first individual project of Module 2 at Turing. We are using classes,creating objects, to run a terminal based game. This is the first time we create our own test files to test our code/outputs.

## Learning Goals
* Contribute to a partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application. [Spec/Prompts](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html)
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, resuable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Overview
Flash Cards is a terminal based game where the player is able to test their JavaScript knowledge. It will let you know if you got the answer correct or incorrect plus give you an overall score at the end.

## To Play
Using the terminal, to play the Flash Cards game the player should...
1) `git clone` this repo 
2) `cd` into the file path of `flash-cards`
3) type `npm install` 
4) then type `node index.js` to start playing the game

Here's an example of the game:
